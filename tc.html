        <p>
          The following Terms and Conditions apply to all bookings and purchases
          made on the website and all the services which are provided at the
          Hotel. We kindly ask that you take a moment to read them prior to
          making a Booking or any other purchases.
          <br />
          The Company enters into this Agreement as principal for Bookings made
          for the hotel it owns and as agent where a Booking is made for a hotel
          that it operates on behalf of the Hotel Owner. The booking
          confirmation will clearly state the identity of the Owner.
          <br />
          <br />
          1. Bookings
          <br />
          All Bookings at the Hotel are subject to these Terms.
          <br />
          At the time of booking or at check-in, we will take your credit/debit
          card details and you authorise the use of this card for any sums that
          become owing to us. We shall also have the right to require full
          payment in advance or a deposit at the time of booking in certain
          circumstances or if the Booking includes the supply of certain items
          or services. No Booking shall be treated as confirmed until the
          details and/or payment/deposit described in this paragraph have been
          provided.
          <br />
          <br />
          2. Charges
          <br />
          The prices displayed on the Websites and at the Hotel are an average
          per night per room until a rate is selected. Any meals, service or VAT
          (at the prevailing rate) are included only if specified. A minimum
          length of stay, deposit, cancellation charge and other conditions may
          apply to certain rates, as specified. Once a rate is selected on the

          the Currency Disclaimer for more details.
          <br />

          VAT, and the expected VAT treatment of the goods or services. VAT will
          be payable at the prevailing rate applicable at the tax point of the
          invoice or Booking confirmation issued, and may change depending on
          the actual rate and the VAT treatment of the goods and services
          purchased at that date.
          <br />
          Price lists for additional items, such as restaurant meals and room
          service, are on display at relevant locations within the Hotel and are
          available on request.
          <br />

          as otherwise required by applicable law in connection with the
          prevention or investigation of crime. The information above may be
          requested for each member of your party over the age of 16 and we
          reserve the right to refuse entry to persons who cannot provide the

          of arrival. All rooms that have been secured by credit/debit card or
          prepaid at the time of booking will he held until 11:59pm on the

          day of arrival at which time we will be entitled to re-let the room,

          On the day of departure we kindly ask all guests to vacate their rooms
          by 10.00 am (unless a later departure is stated as part of your

          (room rate, VAT and any service charge) and anticipated incidentals
          for the duration of your stay against your credit/debit card. We may
          also choose to accept a deposit in place of payment card authorisation
          by another valid form of payment, including cash.
          <br />
          During your stay the Hotel’s system will calculate the incidentals
          charged to your room on a daily basis. If the cost of those
          incidentals exceed the authorisation taken on check-in, further
          authorisation will automatically be requested and if such
          authorisation is not available, we may request another method of
          settlement or a deposit to be provided, failing which we reserve the
          right to restrict access to your room.
          <br />
          All outstanding charges must be paid for in full on check-out from the
          Hotel. If the outstanding charges do not exceed the authorisation
          taken on check-in, the authorisation for the amount not utilised will
          be released, however, we cannot control how long it takes for your
          bank to effect such release. If staying for multiple nights at the
          Hotel we may require you to make payment for any outstanding charges
          on a more frequent basis during your stay.

          preference for a particular room through a "choose your own room"
          facility on the Website, we will use our reasonable efforts to honour
          this preference. However, we may need to allocate an alternative room
          to you for operational or safety reasons. If we need to move you to a
          different room during your booking for which a lower rate is available
          than the rate you booked at, we will refund you the difference in the
          rates.

          What is Cookie Compliance?
          <br />
          From May 2011 a new privacy directive came into effect across the EU.
          The resulting new law requires that websites ask visitors for consent
          to use web cookies. Cookies are an extremely common technology that
          helps websites remember information about you such as your preferences
          as you move between pages or even to track the number of visitors to
          our website. The overreaching aim for the directive is to inform you
          that we are committed to respecting the privacy rights of every
          visitor to our website and to reassure you that we do not use cookies
          to store personal information about you. As part of this, we aim to
          provide you full transparency as to which cookies are being set and
          why they are necessary.
          <br />
          <br />
          What Are Cookies?

        <p>
          To all our prospective and returning guest, we will officially be
          opening as 4th of July 2020 due to Covid 19. We will be taking extra
          measures to protect everyone in the building around continuous
          cleaning, providing hand cleansing product stationed all around the
          communal areas of the Hotel. We will guide all our guest and staff to
          comply with safe distance by increasing our Self Service breakfast
          time. Guest also would have options to eat outside onto our two
          decking and Summer House as well as in side the dinning rooms.
          <br />
          <br />
          This year we have added extra decking to provide additional space and
          choices so that all our guest can enjoy this much needed holiday
          whilst keeping safe.
          <br />
          <br />
          We also have double and twin rooms with balcony with safe distancing
          with sitting area that guest can book. They are very popular rooms
          where guest book months in advance for an amazing view overlooking the
          Sea.
          <br />
          <br />
          Many of our guest have booked in advance to avoid disappointment. I
          would recommend all our potential guest to book via our web site or
          direct by calling the Hotel. And the benefit of booking direct with
          us, so that we can help to book car ferry crossing at half price
          subject to our terms and condition. We have trade account with
          Wightlink Ferry and Red Funnel. And if you have seen hotel prices
          anywhere else cheaper, our promise to you that we will match the
          price, exception of any system glitch. And another reason to book
          direct with us, if your coming for 7 days or more or have large
          bookings, we should be able to provide you with discount.
          <br />
          <br />
          Staff and myself, we are all looking forward to receiving our new and
          repeat guest and we promise to deliver your expectation and create an
          amazing memories of I.O.W. And where we got it wrong on rare
          occasions, we have worked on it and continue with the progression to
          take it to the next level to provide even greater experience to all
          our guest.
          <br />
          <br />
          Lastly, I would like to thank all our guest for staying at the Hotel,
          being on this journey with us who have been so warm and friendly, just
          fabulous and shown their appreciation by their generous comments,
          e-mails,reviews on different platforms,cards, flowers and we are
