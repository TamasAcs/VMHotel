                "Lovely sea views
                Wow we chose this hotel from a photo I saw online and we were not disappointed. We had the family room on the top floor so the views were really amazing. The owner is so welcoming and friendly, she really can not do enough to make your stay memorable. The breakfast was plentiful, there was so much choice. The garden is so welcoming and relaxing. Our room was lovely, clean and comfortable. The only thing that is missing at this hotel is a lift. If I’m ever back in the Isle of White this will be the establishment I would choose to stay at. If you book direct with the hotel they also book the ferry for you at a cheaper rate too."</p>
